# Defeat_enemies
Game to defeat enemies and achieve badges

The purpose of this game is to defeat 3 enemies.
Each enemy has 3 lives.
Each enemy is randomly allocated 0,1,2 or 3 weapons. The player does not know how many.
The player will always defeat an enemy if the player and the enemy both have a weapon.
The player will also defeat an enemy if both are weaponless, but the player will be defeated (game over)
if an enemy has a weapon and the player has none remaining.
The player weapon count is reduced by one every time the players fight, unless the particular enemy is out of weapons.
The player will be asked at the start of play to choose the number of weapons required. As the maximum
number of weapons the enemies can have is 3+3+3 = 9 then the player will always win if they pick 9 or more.
To make the game more challenging, if the player opts for less than 9 weapons they will be in line for a 
reward if they complete the game. These range from bronze (easiest) to 'King of the world' (picking no weapons, where there is only a 1 in 64 chance of winning).
As the player will be able to see how far their weapon count is reducing, they can retire to avoid risking defeat.
